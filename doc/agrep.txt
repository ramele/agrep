Introduction						*Agrep*

Agrep is:

* Designed for search - Vim's |quickfix| is great, but is not the best choice
  to use for searching. Agrep uses a simpler mechanism to manage the results
  (see below) and makes the list of matches very easy to read and navigate.

* Fully asynchronous - Search is done in the background. There is no need to
  wait for the entire process to finish -the matches are displayed as they are
  found in the Agrep window and you can start exploring them immediately. You
  can keep working in Vim as usual while the search is active.

* Fast and lightweight - Most likely the fastest search tool you can get in
  Vim, or in any other editor. Grep is fast, however, integrating it into other
  tools should be done carefully. Agrep is optimized to preserve the speed of
  grep and to keep Vim fully functional while search is running, even for
  massive searches with thousands of matches.

In most cases, you search for things simply because you need to find
something(!), with no intention to perform a complex editing tasks on the
matches or to keep all the matches locations synced with every change you make.

Quickfix (as implied by its name), was created originally to fix errors, so
keeping the list of matches updated is necessary in this case. The overhead of
handling this may become noticeable when using quickfix for searching in large
code bases. Agrep doesn't do all of this so it won't affect Vim's performance
at all.

===============================================================================
Quick start						*Agrep-quick-start*	

Agrep takes the same command line arguments as the shell's grep, for example:

    :Agrep -r 'foo.*bar' ~/my_project

It uses -nH flags by default so you don't need to specify them explicitly.

This command will open the Agrep window automatically. Agrep window status line
will show the search progress (if you don't see it you may need to set
|laststatus| properly).

Hitting Enter or double-clicking the mouse in the Agrep window will take you to
the exact location of the match. The previous window will be used to display
the match.

===============================================================================
Commands						*Agrep-commands*

The following standard commands are available. These commands are similar to
the corresponding quickfix commands (cn, cp, etc.):

							*:Anext*
:[count]Anext		Display the [count] next match.

							*:Aprev*
:[count]Aprev		Display the [count] previous match.

							*:Anfile*
:[count]Anfile		Display the first match in the [count] next file.

							*:Apfile*
:[count]Apfile		Display the last match in the [count] previous file.

							*:Aopen*
:Aopen			Open the Agrep window.

							*:Aclose*
:Aclose			Close the Agrep window.


Additional commands:
							*:Astop*
:Astop			Stop the search and its grep process.

							*:Afilter*
:Afilter[!] {pattern}	Filter the results, keep only the results matching
			{pattern}. When [!] is used, keep only the non-matching
			results. When {pattern} is omitted, the last search
			pattern will be used.

							*:Affilter*
:Affilter[!] {pattern}	Like :Afilter but works on the file names.

							*:Aquickfix*
:Aquickfix		Create a new quickfix list contains all the search
			matches. This is useful if you want to mark the
			locations or to use |:cdo| or |:cfdo| commands.

							*:Anewer*
:Anewer [count]		Go to the [count] newer entry in the Agrep history.

							*:Aolder*
:Aolder [count]		Go to the [count] older entry in the Agrep history.

===============================================================================
Settings						*Agrep-settings*

							*agrep_win_sp_mod*
g:agrep_win_sp_mod	Sets the modifiers for the |:new| command being used to
			display the Agrep window. Default is 'bo 18' so the
			window will be opened at the bottom of the screen and
			its height will be 18 lines. If you want to open the
			window at the right side of the screen add this to
			your .vimrc:

			    let agrep_win_sp_mod = 'botright vert'

							*agrep_default_flags*
g:agrep_default_flags	Sets the default flags to use with the grep command.
			Default is '-I --exclude-dir=.{git,svn}' (exclude binary
			files, .git and .svn directories.

							*agrep_history*
g:agrep_history		Sets the number of history entries (searches) to save.
			Default: 5.

If you want to set some options for the Agrep window only, you can use
'Agrep' as the autocommands pattern. For example:

    if !exists('s:agrep_cmd')
      au BufWinEnter Agrep setlocal nornu | setlocal nowrap
      let s:agrep_cmd = 1
    endif

===============================================================================
Mappings						*Agrep-mappings*

Agrep does not come with predefined mappings, but you may find the following
example useful:

map <Leader>] :<C-U>exe v:count1.(bufwinnr('Agrep') == -1 ? 'cn' : 'Anext')<CR>
map <Leader>[ :<C-U>exe v:count1.(bufwinnr('Agrep') == -1 ? 'cp' : 'Aprev')<CR>

This will use the same mappings to navigate in the quickfix list and in the
Agrep window based on if there is an opened Agrep window in the current tab.
